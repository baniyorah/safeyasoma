All of his efforts have helped put his net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Jay Gruden? As of early-2017, sources estimate a net worth that is at $5 million, mostly earned through a successful career in professional football. During his time as a player, he was part of the Arena Football League (AFL) and won four Arena Bowls. He also won two Arena Bowls as a head coach and as he continues his career, it is expected that his wealth will also continue to increase.</p><h3>Jay Gruden Net Worth $5 million</h3><p>Jay attended George D. Chamberlain High School, where he was part of the school’s football team, the Chamberlain Chiefs. After matriculating, he went to the University of Louisville and would play four years for the Cardinals football team as a quarterback and would become one of the school’s best players in history. During his senior year, he led the team to an 8-3 record, their first winning record in a decade.</p><p>After graduating, Gruden would join the World League of American Football, playing with Barcelona in 1991 and then Scotland later in 1995, but also became part of the NFL and CFL for three seasons mainly as part of practice squads. Eventually, he found his way to the AFL and would win four titles playing for the Tampa Bay Storm, being named as the MVP of the league in 1992, plus numerous other honors including being inducted into the AFL Hall of Fame.</p><p>Jay then transitioned into a coaching career, and became the offensive coordinator of the Nashville Kats in 1997. The following year, he was offered the head coach position of the Orlando Predators, where he would win championships in 1998 and 2000. He then started playing for the Predators in 2002, coming out of retirement. After that, he returned to head coaching after his replacement Fran Papasedero passed away in 2003. In 2002, he became the offensive assistant of the neighbouring NFL team, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, earning a Super Bowl ring in the team’s win in Super Bowl XXXVII. He would stay with the team until 2008, when his brother, <a href=#>Jon Gruden</a> was fired.</p><p>In 2009, Jay would become the offensive coordinator of the United Football League team, the Florida Tuskers, and the head coach of the team a year later. After this run, he was hired as the offensive coordinator of the Cincinnati Bengals. His net worth continued to increase thanks to these numerous opportunities, including signing a three year extension with the team despite offers for head coaching jobs with three other NFL teams.</p><p>In 2014, Jay became the head coach of the Washington Redskins, on a five-year $20 million contract which continued to build his net worth. He helped the team get to the playoffs, winning the NFC East with a 9-7 record, but lost against the Green Bay Packers during the Wild Card round. He was given a contract extension in 2017.</p><p>For his personal life, it is known that Gruden has been married to Sherry since 1990, with whom he has three sons. His father was a former regional scout for the San Francisco 49ers. His brother has been the head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Oakland Raiders.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=4.4908256880734><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Jay Gruden</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>March 4, 1967</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Tiffin, Ohio, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6' 2" (1.88 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>91&nbsp;kg</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>American football coach</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>University of Louisville, George D.
